# WOOF-IOT
A revolutionary IOT platform enabling pet owners to track the environment of their four-legged loved ones.

WOOF IOT utilizes a ESP-8266 along with a DHT11/22 temperature sensor to measure the temperature inside my dog's house. The project involves designing and 3D printing a specialized snap together enclosure that will house the device. WOOF IOT has a built in web interface, WiFi Manager, and support for Apple Homekit and Siri (with an additional HomeBridge Server).

This repo contains all the source code and 3D CAD files that you need to make your own device. The full step by step instructions and demo video are availablee on my website: https://www.filipcuoco.com/woof-iot-an-experiment-in-iot/
